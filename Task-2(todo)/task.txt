**Task: Interactive To-Do List**

**Description:**
Create an interactive to-do list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The to-do list should allow users to:

1. Add new tasks with a specified deadline.
2. Mark tasks as completed.
3. Remove tasks from the list.

**Requirements:**

1. **HTML:**
   - Include input fields for task description and deadline.
   - Display a list of tasks with checkboxes for completion and a delete button for each task.

2. **CSS:**
   - Style your to-do list to make it visually appealing.
   - Apply different styles for completed and uncompleted tasks.

3. **JavaScript:**
   - Use JavaScript to handle adding tasks to the list.
   - Implement functionality to mark tasks as completed (checkbox).
   - Add a delete button for each task to remove it from the list.
   - Provide a clear and user-friendly interface.

4. **Optional:**
   - Add local storage functionality to persist tasks even after a page refresh.
   - Allow users to edit task descriptions and deadlines.

This task will give you hands-on experience with DOM manipulation, event handling, and managing state in a web application. It also introduces the concept of persisting data using local storage for a more complete user experience. Have fun working on this project, and feel free to customize and expand upon it as you see fit!

One task related to web development in JavaScript is to create a dynamic form validation script. This task involves writing JavaScript code to validate user input in a web form to ensure that the data entered is in the correct format and meets specific criteria.

Here's a simplified example of what the task might entail:

**Task: Dynamic Form Validation**

**Description:**
Create a JavaScript script that validates a user registration form. The form should have fields for the user's name, email address, password, and password confirmation. The validation script should ensure the following criteria are met:

1. Name: Should be at least 3 characters long and contain only letters.

2. Email: Should be a valid email address format (e.g., user@example.com).

3. Password: Should be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.

4. Password Confirmation: Should match the password field.

**Requirements:**

- Write JavaScript code to perform real-time validation as the user fills out the form.

- Display error messages for each field when the input doesn't meet the criteria.

- Change the border or background color of the input fields to indicate validation status (e.g., green for valid, red for invalid).

- Disable the form's submission button until all fields are valid.

- Provide feedback to the user to guide them in correcting the errors.

- Make the validation as user-friendly as possible, with clear and concise error messages.

This task involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly form validation experience. It's a common task in web development to ensure that user input is accurate and secure.

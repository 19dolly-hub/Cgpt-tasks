# Dynamic Form Validation Task

## Description
Create a dynamic form validation script using JavaScript for a user registration form. The form should include fields for the user's name, email address, password, and password confirmation. The validation script should enforce the following criteria:

1. **Name**: Should be at least 3 characters long and contain only letters.
2. **Email**: Should be in a valid email address format (e.g., user@example.com).
3. **Password**: Should be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
4. **Password Confirmation**: Should match the password field.

## Requirements
To complete this task, you need to:

- Write JavaScript code to perform real-time validation as the user fills out the form.
- Display error messages for each field when the input doesn't meet the criteria.
- Change the border or background color of the input fields to indicate validation status (e.g., green for valid, red for invalid).
- Disable the form's submission button until all fields are valid.
- Provide feedback to the user to guide them in correcting the errors.
- Make the validation as user-friendly as possible, with clear and concise error messages.

This task involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly form validation experience. It's a common task in web development to ensure that user input is accurate and secure.
